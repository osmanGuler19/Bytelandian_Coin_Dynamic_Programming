# Bytelandian_Coin_Dynamic_Programming

This is a basic dynamic programming problem. Basic idea is, split your problem subproblems and don't do operations which previously did. Save the previous answers and speed up processing. Because now you don't have to calculate again and again.

So here is the quesiton :

# Question
In Byteland they have a very strange monetary system.

Each Bytelandian gold coin has an integer number written on it. A coin n can be exchanged in a bank into three coins: n/2, n/3 and n/4. But these numbers are all rounded down (the banks have to make a profit).

You can also sell Bytelandian coins for American dollars. The exchange rate is 1:1. But you can not buy Bytelandian coins.

You have one gold coin. What is the maximum amount of American dollars you can get for it?
